The Final Project of CS50x, where my task was to create a study helper, named Staid. This repository will be updated periodically as I continue to complete the project. This README will be updated properly once the project is completed. This READ.ME is a WIP & not the final version.

Above is video showing the Web App & the usage of each feature. Each feature is explained greater in depth below. This was taken using a development server to show the functionality of Staid. Apologies for the poor quality, I will be updating it soon.
